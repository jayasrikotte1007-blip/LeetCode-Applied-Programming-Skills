**Running sum of 1D Array**

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]
 
Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

**Approach**
To find the running sum, we keep adding the current element to a cumulative sum. Start with sum = 0, then for each element in the array, add it to sum and store the updated value in the result array. This way, each position contains the sum of all elements up to that index.
