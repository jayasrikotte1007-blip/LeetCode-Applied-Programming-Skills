**Contains-Duplicate-11**

Given an integer array nums and an integer k, return true if there are two distinct indices i and j in the array such that nums[i] == nums[j] and abs(i - j) <= k.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1], k = 3
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1,0,1,1], k = 1
Output: true
Example 3:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,2,3], k = 2
Output: false
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 105
-109 <= nums[i] <= 109
0 <= k <= 105

**Approach**

I thought about this problem like this: I need to find two equal numbers in the array that are close to each other, at most `k` positions apart. To do that, I can go through the array one by one and remember the last position where each number appeared. I can use a `HashMap` for that, where the key is the number and the value is its latest index. Every time I see a number, I check if it is already in the map. If it is, I calculate the difference between the current index and the last index. If the difference is less than or equal to `k`, I know the condition is satisfied, so I return `true`. If not, I update the index in the map and keep checking the rest of the array. If I reach the end without finding any such pair, I return `false`.

This way, I only need to go through the array **once**, and I can quickly check for duplicates using the map.
