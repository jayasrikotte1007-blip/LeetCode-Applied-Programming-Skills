**Running-Sum-of-1D-Array**

Given an array nums. We define a running sum of an array as runningSum[i] = sum(nums[0]…nums[i]).

Return the running sum of nums.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,3,6,10]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+2, 1+2+3, 1+2+3+4].

Example 2:
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1]
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
Explanation: Running sum is obtained as follows: [1, 1+1, 1+1+1, 1+1+1+1, 1+1+1+1+1].

Example 3:
Input: nums = [3,1,2,10,1]
Output: [3,4,6,16,17]

Constraints:
1 <= nums.length <= 1000
-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

**Approach**
I thought about this problem by imagining we go through the array one element at a time. For each element, we add it to the sum of all the previous elements. To do this easily, I can just update each element in the array itself. I start from the second element (index 1) and add the previous element’s value to it. I repeat this for every element in the array. By the end, every element will contain the running sum up to that point. This way, we don’t need any extra array; we just reuse the original
